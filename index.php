                        Welcome to PetScan, a revolutionary digital dermatology tool designed specifically for mobile phones. 
                        Leveraging the power of advanced image recognition and machine learning technologies, 
                        PetScan is here to transform the way you care for your furry friends' skin health.

                        <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
                        <p>
                        By simply uploading a photo of the area on your pet where a potential skin issue is present, 
                        PetScan will analyze the image to predict possible skin diseases. 
                        PetScan uses machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to make these predictions.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        PetScan has been trained on images of pet skin conditions. 
                        Over time, it has "learned" to recognize patterns in these images, 
                        allowing it to make educated guesses about what might be affecting your pet based on the photo you provide. 
                        <br><br>This way, PetScan helps you identify potential skin problems, so you can take the right steps toward ensuring your pet’s well-being.
